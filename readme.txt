== Description ==

[Enable Numeric Slugs](https://squaredaway.studio/wordpress-plugin-enable-numeric-slugs/) plugin fixes postname(slug) can not be a 4 digit number issue on wordpress 4.9.1. As a matter of fact, its not a bug, wordpress reserve 4 digit number in url for yearly archive. I just simply remove the rewrite rules stored in MySql. If you want to reset to orignal rewrite rules, go to Permalink Settings and Save Changes. That's it..
